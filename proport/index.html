      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a web developer with a strong background in building responsive, user-friendly websites and applications. I recently completed a comprehensive 24-week Industrial Training program at Techbankk Intl Ltd, where I worked on various practical projects ranging from a personal portfolio and video upload site to tools like a CGPA calculator, a food recipe website, and a task management app.
      </p>
      <p>
        My expertise spans across both frontend and backend development, with proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and SQLite. I have hands-on experience creating clean, professional UI designs, form validation systems, user authentication features, and database integration. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I've successfully built full-stack applications such as a shopping list app, a budget calculator, and a personal finance manager. I also have experience in responsive design, making my work accessible and seamless across devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my notable achievements was developing a CGPA calculator and result tracker tailored for student self-management — a project that merged utility with simplicity. I’ve also contributed to building a website for Techbankk itself, demonstrating my ability to deliver professional work in a real-world setting.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm passionate about continuous learning, and I enjoy solving problems through clean, efficient code. I aim to build digital experiences that are both visually appealing and functionally robust.
